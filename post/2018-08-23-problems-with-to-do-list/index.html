<ol>
<li>I could bookmark the article. However, once bookmarked I doubt I will read and remember it later.</li>
<li>Writing a summary of an article helps me memorize and understand the most important part of the article.</li>
<li><a href=https://medium.com>Medium</a> is quite heavy to access, so I put it here for faster access and for my archive.</li>

<h3 id=problems-with-to-do-list>Problems With To-Do List</h3>
<p>To-do list is used to write down stuff that must be done within a time period. It’s easy to do, just write things that must be done, do it, then cross it off from the list. However, there are some problems with to-do list :</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>We as human are terrible at estimating how long tasks take.</strong></p>
<p>With to-do lists, we optimistically assume that most of the day’s tasks will take less time than what they’ll actually take. This causes the to-do list to “roll” into tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>To-do lists are never quite done (some almost always “roll” into tomorrow).</strong></p>
<p>Once we finished a task in the to-do list, we will realize that the task wil give birth to a new set of tasks. These new tasks will end up on the bottom of our to-do list, which make it seems our work is never done. At the end of the day, these half-completed to-do list will hinder us from feeling a sense of completion with our day and our work.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>To-do lists allow us to avoid the important.</strong></p>
<p>To-do lists cause us to be overly proactive in our thinking. Which, in turn, causes us to put a greater emphasis on tasks that  (in the broader scheme of things)  aren’t that important.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id=the-solution>The Solution</h3>
<p>Instead of writing down dozens of tasks that we need to get done each day, <strong>choose one that MUST get done and will deliver the most impact</strong>. If you don’t know which task is the most impactful, just remember: it’s usually the thing you least want to do. Once finished, you can always go back to executing other low-priority or other operational tasks.</p>
<h3 id=example>Example</h3>
<p>Suppose we have a to-do list that belongs to Jim, a sales professional that works for a technology startup :</p>
<ol>
<li>Get email inbox to zero.</li>
<li>Catch up on Slack messages.</li>
<li>Follow-up with Paul about lunch tomorrow.</li>
<li>Meet with the marketing team for “brainstorming” session.</li>
<li>Stop by the grocery.</li>
<li>Make ‘50’ cold calls to potential leads.</li>
<li>Do a couple loads of laundry.</li>
<li>Clean the house.</li>
</ol>
<p>While cleaning the house, doing the laundry, etc. might be nice, they aren’t going to create the most impact for the day. However, if you’re a sales professional like Jim (where you get paid to make sales) you better make sure you’re working on your 50 cold calls for the day.</p>

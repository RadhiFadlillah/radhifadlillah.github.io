It's easy to do, just write things that must be done, do it, then cross it off from the list. However, there are some problems with to-do list :<ul><li><p><strong>We as human are terrible at estimating how long tasks take.</strong><p>With to-do lists, we optimistically assume that most of the day's tasks will take less time than what they'll actually take. This causes the to-do list to "roll" into tomorrow.<li><p><strong>To-do lists are never quite done (some almost always "roll" into tomorrow).</strong><p>Once we finished a task in the to-do list, we will realize that the task wil give birth to a new set of tasks. These new tasks will end up on the bottom of our to-do list, which make it seems our work is never done. At the end of the day, these half-completed to-do list will hinder us from feeling a sense of completion with our day and our work.<li><p><strong>To-do lists allow us to avoid the important.</strong><p>To-do lists cause us to be overly proactive in our thinking. Which, in turn, causes us to put a greater emphasis on tasks that  (in the broader scheme of things)  aren't that important.</ul><h3 id=the-solution>The Solution</h3><p>Instead of writing down dozens of tasks that we need to get done each day, <strong>choose one that MUST get done and will deliver the most impact</strong>. If you don't know which task is the most impactful, just remember: it’s usually the thing you least want to do. Once finished, you can always go back to executing other low-priority or other operational tasks.<h3 id=example>Example</h3><p>Suppose we have a to-do list that belongs to Jim, a sales professional that works for a technology startup :<ol><li>Get email inbox to zero.<li>Catch up on Slack messages.<li>Follow-up with Paul about lunch tomorrow.<li>Meet with the marketing team for "brainstorming" session.<li>Stop by the grocery.<li>Make '50' cold calls to potential leads.<li>Do a couple loads of laundry.<li>Clean the house.</ol><p>While cleaning the house, doing the laundry, etc. might be nice, they aren't going to create the most impact for the day. However, if you’re a sales professional like Jim (where you get paid to make sales) you better make sure you're working on your 50 cold calls for the day.<div class=reader__tags><p>Tags:</p><a href=/blog/tag-lifehack>#lifehack</a>

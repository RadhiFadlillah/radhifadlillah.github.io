It's simple enough to do in Go, just concurrently fetch the pages via <code>goroutine</code>, parse it with <code>goquery</code>, then save it to database. Unfortunately, the scraping is failed because the website detects that there are too many concurrent requests from my IP.<p>To work around this, I limit the number of goroutines to max 10 at a time. Fortunately, this is really easy thanks to channels and <code>sync</code> package :<pre class=chroma><span class=kn>package</span> <span class=nx>main</span>

</pre><p>As you can see, the code itself is really simple. For <code>guard</code>, I use channel of empty struct instead of other types like boolean or integer. This is because empty structs occupies zero bytes of storage, which means we can put as many guard as we want without worrying about memory usage. For more details about empty structs, do check out the <a href=https://dave.cheney.net/2014/03/25/the-empty-struct>article</a> by Dave Cheney which thoroughly explains about empty structs.<div class=reader__tags><p>Tags:</p><a href=/blog/tag-golang>#golang</a></div><div class=reader__sibling><a href=/blog/2018-09-29-use-fathom-for-analytic class=reader__sibling__prev>Use Fathom for Analytic</a>
